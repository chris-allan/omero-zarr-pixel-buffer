# OMERO Zarr Pixel Buffer

## Requirements

- OMERO 5.6+
- Java 11+

## Artifacts

The latest artifacts built and deployed by GitHub actions can be found on the
[Glencoe Software artifactory](https://artifacts.glencoesoftware.com/)

## Usage

The OMERO Zarr Pixel Buffer follows the principles of a classical OMERO.server
[service extension](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.10/developers/Server/ExtendingOmero.html#services).

After putting the `omero-zarr-pixel-buffer.jar` under `lib/server`, the server
must be restarted. To use the ZarrPixelBuffer, an Image or Mask object must be populated with
an [ExternalInfo](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero-blitz/5.7.2/slice2html/omero/model/ExternalInfo.html)
object with the following properties:

-   `entityType` must be set to `com.glencoesoftware.ngff:multiscales`
-   `entityId` must be set to `3`
-   `lsid` must be set to the location of the Zarr data:
    - the absolute path to the dataset if available via the filesystem
    - an URI defined as `s3://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<path/to/dataset.zarr>`
      for datasets stored on Amazon S3

The Zarr dataset must be conformant with the default layout generated by `bioformats2raw` i.e.:

-    the version of the NGFF specification must be 0.4
-    the image and the Zarr multiscales group must have 5 declared dimensions
-    the chunks must be stored in the (t, c, z, y, x) order
-    the resolution level must be downsampled along the (y, x) axis

Permissions for accessing Zarr dataset hosted on S3 buckets can be managed:

- either via named profiles stored under a local credentials file as for the AWS CLI
- or via EC2 instance profile condifigured with a policy allowing to assume an IAM role
